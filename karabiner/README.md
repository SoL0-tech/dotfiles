## Karabiner

Let's face it - *nobody needs caps-lock*.
It doesn't deserve that prime real-estate.


This is how I chose to remap my Caps key:

1. If caps is pressed and released, it functions as **ESC**.
2. If caps is pressed in combination with another key, it acts as **CTRL**

This remapping is accomplished by a combination of Native OS-X remapping to Ctrl, then Karabiner configured with the JSON file in this directory.
